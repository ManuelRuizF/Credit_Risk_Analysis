# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
So for this work we are going to do an analsys on credit card risk. Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. To make this machine learning model we are going to do the following:  
- Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
- Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
- Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk  
We will evaluate each model and compared them. According to the results we will anañyze if it´s worth using it for this project.

## Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
